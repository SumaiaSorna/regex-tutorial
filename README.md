# Regular Expression (Regex)

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects.

## Project Objective

A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

## Summary

Throughout this tutorial I explained a couple of specific Regexes with examples, so that users can understand how these works. At the end, I added an example covering the Regex components described here.

## Regex Components

Although varies use of the Regex in different programming languages, the common regular expression components are discussed below:

### Anchors

Anchors are characters that specify the location within a particular string to search. To find a character "A" in a string, you can use characters from the following list to find a match within a line:

```
^A : Match at the beginning of a line.
A$ : Match at the end of a line.
```
